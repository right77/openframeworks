## Project 1
This is a well-known fairy tale in China. NuWa is the mother goddess of Chinese myths, who created humans and repaired the holes in the sky. People generally tell the story as protected people,praising the goddess for protection. The appearance of Nuwa is also described in different ways. I want users to forget the image and worship of the goddess to imagine how a lonely person knew the chaotic world and then tried to save the world.

Scene 1
In ancient books, people describe her as the creator of all things, so I made this animation to introduce the user that this square is Nuwa.

Scene2
In ancient times, it was very lonely for her to explore the world alone. Users can use the mouse to control the movement of nuwa around the vast world. After clicking the mouse, nuwa made a little person out of clay. I will add some animation to show how human suddenly become alive.

Scene3
Then Nuwa learned a new way to quickly create human. I have a question about how to control these random points going around the square.

Scene4
People were frightened back by the fight. Sound and more details are needed to explain this scene.

Scene5
Here is the flood. Affected by the flood, the square will gradually move to the right of the screen. User click to help Nuwa mend the holes.

The last scene

## Questions

1.How to better illustrate the flood and the hole in the sky with graphics and animation?
I tried to draw some curves, but don't know how to let them move like a flood submerging a village.

2.How to control the speed of the block's movement, so that it looks as if it is moving towards the point where the mouse clicks, while being blocked by the flood.

## Next step

1.action scene of the fight between gods can be very funny here. I will focus these scene next week to find out the way to show the fierce fight, so users can understand why the fight caused the disaster.

2. Add sound.

3. Correct the script of story.
