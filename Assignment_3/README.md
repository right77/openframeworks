# Project1

1. Who is the user?

Children or adults who are interestes in Chinese mythical stories.

2. What do you want them to experience?

The story describes how the Chinese goddess Nuwa repaired the sky and saved humans from a disaster resulted from a fight of gods. It reflects the tortuous course of prehistory China. I expect an interesting experience for users to learn more about Chinese culture and Nuwa 's dedication in this story.


3. How will your translation achieve this?

I will design interactions for users to play the role of Nuwa, click the screen and fix the sky.
Use shapes and animation to show the scene of disaster.
